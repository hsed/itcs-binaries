>In our rapidly moving world, people are moving faster than ever before. The cars on our roads are more advanced than they ever have been and now we need a traffic management system to match.

Enter ***ITCS*** â€“ the innovative new product which will revolutionise the way we drive, making traffic on our roads faster, safer and more fuel-efficient using clever mesh-network technology. Our state of the art mesh network topology combined with a clever communications and sensor will enable vehicles on the road to communicate with each other, much in the same way as a driver might have communicated with another in the past, except for the fact that these controllers never make mistakes and always knows the right decision to make.


## Progress
Currently there is some prospective simulation binaries for visualisation, some more improvements can be incorporated later.
